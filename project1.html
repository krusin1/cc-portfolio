    I received the following description from my partner: <br>
    A green coin purse handmade from woollen thread with a string at the top to tighten the purse. <br>
    <br>
    Language my partner used to describe the image:  <br>
    My partner described the object in a simple but descriptive way that could help me picture how the object would have looked. He focused on the color and material of this object and also later explained to me that this was something that his grandmother had made for him. <br>
    <br>
    My interpretation of the image:<br>
    I had a picture in my head as soon as I heard the description of 'a string at the top to tighten the purse' because there can be several kinds of coin purses. I was keen on depicting the wool knit texture somehow. <br>
    <br>
    The depiction of the image using code:<br>
    Using ellipses, trapeziums and curves I was able to form the shape of the coin purse with strings. I then added the floor for the purse to sit on. I initially struggled to add a knit-like texture to the purse. But later, with help I realized I could use a looping function to create the v shaped knitting pattern and use the blend mode to mask it on to the purse alone. In the end I also used the mouse hover function to add a little bit of fun to the sketch with the coins popping out of the purse when you hover your mouse over the purse. I added dollar signs on the coins and used the translate and rotate functions here. <br>
    <br>
    The differences in interpretation at all stages of the assignment: <br>
    I think that the shape of the coin purse itself is very 'perfect' and not a more organic shape a knitted purse would form when sitting on a table. Like I previously mentioned, I struggled with the knit pattern and ended up with something I am satisfied with but again it is too 'perfect' I would like to find and experiment in the coming weeks about how I can make something look more real and organic. I am also unsure of what exact shade of green the object actually is. Hong did mention it to be a darker green so I assumed it to be this particular shade of green.
