        <b>Your partnersâ€™ names:</b>
    Amna, Cindy, Hong <br>

    <b>Design Process:</b> <br>
    In my team, we completed each of our characters seperately before revealing it to each other and exchanging body parts. Using functions was pretty straightforward. I received three p5.js sketches from my partners and then proceeded to swap out my functions with theirs. I tweaked position and size a little bit to make sure the parts align with each other. <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Story:</b> <br>
    I came up with an idea of a skeleton trying really hard to become human. So he ends up making some strange friends that agree to exchange body parts to make him more human. 
    He receives various parts and in the end is left quite unsure of whether this was a good idea. His changing colors show all the emotions he's going through.<br>
    <br>
    
    <b>Reflection:</b> <br>
    After doing this, I realized we might have done it differently from how everyone else did which was exchanging drawing first and then coding but I feel like this was more exciting to see each others' idea come to life in code.
    This was a lot of fun. It was interesting to see how different each of our characters ended up being. Exchanging sketches and creating the new character was made very easy with the functions.</div>
