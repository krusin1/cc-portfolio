            I tracked all the 'new' things I did in a week like interacting with new people, getting to know new people, taking new pictures, eating something new, cooking something new,working on something new, watching something new and going to a new place <br>
            <br>
        How to Read:<br>
        the number of arcs represents the number of times the following things happened <br>
        <ol>
            <li>red: interacting with someone new (including talking to staff at stores and restaurants) </li>
            <li>orange: getting to know someone new</li>
            <li>yellow: Eating something new</li>
            <li>green:Cooking something new</li>
            <li>blue: Working on something new</li>
            <li>purple: Going to a new place</li>
            <li>magenta: Watching something new</li>
            <li>pink: Pictures of something new</li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <b>Design Process:</b> <br>
        I wanted to track something that I've often wondered about but never bothered to track because it isn't really important knowledge.<br>
        I tracked my data in an excel sheet and converted them to 7 arrays which I nested into another array for ease of use. <br>
        Using these array, for loops, conditional statements and frameRate adjustments I was able to end up with arcs of data animated to look like they are stacking up one by one.<br>
        It was challenging to use arcs to line up and kept getting a lot of strange errors.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Reflection:  </b><br>
        It was interesting to realize that I do a lot more new things every week than I realized. I think things feel stagnant when we're busy or a lot of things we do everyday are repetetive but tracking it feels very interesting and puts things into perspective. <br>
        I think that there are some issues with the visual with some of the arcs overlapping. I'm not sure how to fix it but I think a different visual can add to how easily this data can be understood. If I were to do this again, I would visualize the data differently in different shapes. <br>
        I don't think any data is really lost since it is exactly the same values from my excel sheet but I think there can be more added to it. <br>
