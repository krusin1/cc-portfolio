        Sometimes aren't aware of how much things are changing and how we are getting older with time until we look at how much an object from our childhood and see how much it has aged. I think we have a very strong realization of how much time has passed in those moments. So, I decide to show time through the ageing of a teddy bear. The years stop at 23 just because I'm 23 years old! <br>
        <br>
        <b>Process:</b> <br>
        I used the millis() function to track time and display each second as years on screen. I used the if-else conditional statements to change the background, the bear's features and the photo frame in the background every 3 seconds till 23. I also used the map() function to get the bear's eyes to follow the mouse. Also used the boolean operators to switch between night and day in the window.
        I initially did each of the elements seperately to make sure they work. I think I had issues popping up when I combined all these portions. Initially I had the bear's features skip a few seconds in the middle but then realized I just needed to switch '<' with '<='. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Reflection:</b><br>
        It got challenging with so many different portions of the code. Also, the arrangement of the code decides where each shape sits (on top or below other shapes) so it was interesting to have to work around that. <br>
        I think I should work on organizing my code better using comments next time. It is quite difficult even for myself to find things in my code.<br>
        I added two functions when the code was getting too crowded to make things easier to read.<br>
        It was also a little tedious having to work on every frame of the bear's ageing process. Maybe I should think about how I can make that a shorter, easier sketch. <br>
        It was pretty interesting to think about different ways to look at time and overall I enjoyed working on this concept very much.</div>
